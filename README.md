# Calculator with Java and TDD

This is a simple Java project that shows how to parse arguments with regular expressions and 
perform calculations using BigDecimal. It is developed using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) method. TDD is a software development process that supports creating automated tests before the actual code. Now a standard best practice for developers working in an Agile development environment, it saves programmers from having to debug and rework their software. Instead, programmers can focus on the design and coding part.

In TDD, a test case is first created for a particular feature, normally a class. If the testcase fails, new code is written to pass it. The code is then refactored until the test passes for all the parameters or given scenarios. 

This project is structured according to Maven directory structure and includes a test class (CalculatorTest) for various scenarios.
